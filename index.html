    <h1>Differences in Climate by Latitude</h1>

    <!-- Summary text -->
    <p>The goal of this project was to explore how weather and climate changes occur as a result of differences in latitude. Data from OpenWeatherMap API was used to create a dataset
        with cities across the globe.
    </p>

    <p>
        A variety of visualizations were created using Matplotlib in order to more effectively display the data. The topics of interest were temperature, cloudiness,
        wind speed, and humidity. On this page, you can find all graphs and their requisite analyses. The source data is also provided.
