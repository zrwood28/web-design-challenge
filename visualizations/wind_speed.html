    <!-- Summary -->
    <h4>
        Generally, it seems that there might be a minor relationship between wind speed and a city's latitude. 
        Many data points in and around the equator seem to have low wind speeds with a handful of ciities that are above average.
        Additionally, many places with the fastest wind speeds overall are at latitudinal extremes, and the few fastest are far North 
        from the equator. Only one city eclipsed 35mph winds, and two more reached 30mph.
