    <!-- Summary -->
    <h4>
        There does not seem to be any clear relationship between humidity and latitude. There might be slightly higher
        humidity in cities around the equator, as warm air generally causes more rapid evaporation. The geographical features
        of a city may play a bigger role in humidity; a desert city would likely be less humid than a coastal one regardless of 
        the distance from the equator.
