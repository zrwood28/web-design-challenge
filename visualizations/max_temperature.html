    <!-- Summary -->
    <h4>
        Everything around a latitude of zero, or the equator, tends to be quite warm relative to the rest of the world.
        Temperatures more heavily decline in Northern hemisphere cities at the time the data was collected, which is likely because
        of the seasonal difference and the amount of sunlight exposure these places get in January. The Earth's tilt allows more
        sunlight to Southern cities making their temperatures more comprable to regions near the equator.
