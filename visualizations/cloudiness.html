    <!-- Summary -->
    <h4>
        There doesn't seem to be any clear relationship with the level of cloud cover and latitude at the time measured. It would be interesting to measure this particular data
        over a longer span of time rather than just on one day, as cloud cover might vary greatly on a day-to-day basis. That being said, one notable observation is the fact that 
        many cities, regardless of their latitude, seem to have either no clouds or almost full cloud coverage. Cities that have partial cloud coverage are more sparse.
